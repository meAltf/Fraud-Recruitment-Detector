- Online Recruitment Fraud is the main problem for any job seeker. It exposes loss of privacy, economic damage or harms the reputation of the stakeholders of ATS(Application Tracking System). 

- Police departments donâ€™t have the proper resources to trace the hacker who has posted these fake job postings, and it has to be multi million dollar fraud before federal authorities get involved, so the scammers just keep getting away with it.
